Whitening is a skin care requirement that is mostly loved by Asian consumers, and China is the largest market. According to the report "arbutin Market Status and Future Development Trends of the Global and China arbutin Market 2022-2028" by Jane Chambo, the global arbutin market sales volume in 2021 is $100 million, and analysts predict that the market sales volume will reach $160 million in 2028, with a compound growth rate of 7.1% in 2022-2028.

The European Union's Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS) has issued its final opinion on the safety of alpha-arbutin and beta-arbutin in cosmetic products. The maximum concentration of alpha-arbutin in creams is 2%, in body lotions 0.5%, and β-arbutin in creams 7%. Both ingredients are safe below the maximum concentration, even when used together.

The price of α-arbutin is the highest in the market, the unit price is $1000/kg. The reason for the high price is that it is very difficult to synthesize. At the same time, the whitening effect of α-arbutin is more than 10 times that of β-arbutin, its safety is also better than β-arbutin, not only strong stability, but also high temperature resistance, water soluble, widely used in water, milk, cream preparation cosmetics.

However, due to cost reasons, the most commonly added product on the market is beta-arbutin. Compared with the raw material price of α-arbutin, the price of β-arbutin is less than one third.
